**Ironhack - Project 1**

## Motivation 
I created this project based on a game algorithm I discovered from watching a  documentary on Netflix called, "The Secret Rules of Modern Living Algorithms (2015)".

## About Jewel Thief
It is a timed math game. Jewel Thief is not really that fun to play :-), as I am not really into video games.

I created this game to practice JavaScript. I did not use any HTML Canvas while making this game. I made this program in a little less then a week, so there might be a few bugs.

### The Rules
The rules of Jewel Thief are as follows:
* We start with 14 items, the program and the player can remove a max of 1-3 items per turn and the last one to remove the final item looses the game.
* The player must make a move before the timer runs out.




### About The Algorithm
The program the user plays against, is set to always subtract 4 from the users selection (this is hard-mode). This results in the program always winning, but this is not apparent to the player. 

I also created another "difficulty" level (easy-mode) which randomizes if the program removes 4 from the users selection, which gives the player an opportunity to win.

**Note**
* To submit a turn on "hard-mode", the player needs to press the "Enter" button on their keyboard.
